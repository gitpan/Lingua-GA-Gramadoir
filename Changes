ChangeLog Summary

Version 0.60->0.70
  * Massive expansion of lexicon, especially handling of non-standard
    spellings for Caighdeánaitheoir
  * Nearly double the number of grammatical rules
  * Small bug fixes

Version 0.51->0.60
  * Lexicon additions, improvements, and bug fixes (some unnecessary
    inflections removed)
  * Rule set more than tripled in size, now covering a wide range of Irish
    grammar, including nearly all rules concerning missing or unnecessary
    initial mutations
  * Simplification of the tagset, some regular expression optimizations,
    less dependence on part-of-speech macros, and the restructuring of a few
    slow rules lead to another 5% speed improvement despite the massively
    larger rule set
  * Added warnings for many "dangerous pairs" based on corpus analysis
  * Now correctly tokenizes numerals, including years, ordinals like "5ú",
    and plurals like "1950í".
  * Many morphological rules added for treating pre-standard orthography;
    together with work on the replacement file, these allow An Gramadóir to
    be used as a "normalizer" for indexing, information retrieval, etc.

Version 0.50->0.51
  * Lexicon additions and improvements
  * Improved error trapping
  * Improved Perl code generation (consistent use of non-capturing
    parentheses, etc.) giving 5% speed improvement.
  * Perl implementation of developer options "--brill", "--freq", "--ambig"
    distributed in the language pack gramadoir-ga-0.51.
  * Added "--no-unigram" option to gram-ga.pl
  * POD documentation for gram-ga.pl

Version 0.4->0.50
  * Complete rewrite of core engine entirely in Perl
  * Default output encoding is now utf8; added a "--aschod" option to change
    this
  * The default is now to report all spelling errors in a sentence (was at
    most two)
  * Added a complete morphological analyzer which greatly improves the error
    messages when words are not found in the lexicon.
  * The morphology engine also improves handling of late capitals so words
    like "d'Fhoras", "Sean-Nós" are passed over silently as correct now.
    Also, since the lowered version of a word like "hAire" is not
    automatically searched (since the capitalized version is in the
    lexicon), this gets the correct, unambiguous masculine POS tag. Or in
    "bPáirtí Glas", the first word is now recognized unambiguously as a noun
    which then has the added benefit of allowing "Glas" to be correctly
    recognized as an adjective.
  * Line numbers are now given where the error occurs (was the line number
    of the beginning of the sentence containing the error).
  * Non-standard words are now tagged so as to be reported as misspellings
    when the "--litriu" flag is given.
  * Doubled words only reported when there is no intervening punctuation;
    the two words together are now marked up as the erroneous text.
  * Bug from unescaped "$" in bash version goes away with perl
  * Global highlighting bug fixed (e.g. "re" in "gach re" caused the "re" in
    "toibreacha" to be highlighted also).
  * No more "uimhir" line number attribute in intermediate XML
  * Use character entities "&quot;", etc. in "--api", "--html", and "--xml"
    output
  * Added "--api" command line option which generates XML output suitable
    for use as an interface to other programs
  * Added command line options "--aschur", "--dath", "--comheadan"
  * I cracked and added English versions of the long command-line options
  * Improvements (adding to .neamhshuim) and bug fixes to Vim interface
  * Afrikaans localization

Version 0.3->0.4
  * Rule set more than double the size (improved generation of Perl code
    means no loss in efficiency, in fact a 15% improvement)
  * "tag 2-gram" rules added that flag unlikely part-of-speech combinations
  * Complete Brill-like rule-based tagger added with 331 disambiguation
    rules followed by a default unigram tagger
  * Added developer options "--brill", "--ilchiall", "--minic", and
    "--no-unigram" useful for developing the tagger
  * Module for "chunking" of set phrases added
  * Language-dependent modules added for recognizing abbreviations; improves
    sentence segmentation
  * Added "--aspell" option which makes suggestions for misspelled words
  * Modularized more language-specific material (tolower, macro files, etc.)
  * Flagging of repeated words
  * Flagging of extremely rare words (which sometimes disguise misspellings)
  * Dutch, French, Mongolian, Romanian, and Slovak localizations
  * Now builds and runs cleanly in a UTF-8 locale
  * Vim interface gramadoir.vim included
  * Minor bug fixes

Version 0.2->0.3
  * Optional native language support with GNU gettext (with translations to
    Irish and German included)
  * Added ability to specify text encoding via "--ionchod" command line
    option
  * Modularized language-specific material; added trivial English port and
    the "--teanga" command line option
  * Ported to build cleanly under Mac OS X
  * Added new (mostly grammar) rules
  * Minor bug fixes
  * New "extras" in tarball: emacs interface, complete CVS ChangeLog

Version 0.1->0.2
  * Added the "replacement file" containing non-standard forms
  * Added user "ignore file" and "--iomlan" command line option
  * Added new disambiguation and grammar rules
  * More robust handling of exceptional input text
  * Minor bug fixes
